# Modelling mammals diversity in a climate change scenario

The objective is to model the occurrence of mammals species in a climate change scenario and to make predictions for the period year 2050-2079. Further, the report also is used to compare and evaluate the performance of the different statistical models. The general approach is to fit my models with data, evaluate their performance and make predictions. I want to predict the occurrence of the mammals as a species richness index meaning the number of species in a given raster cell of 1°*1° (x, y).
